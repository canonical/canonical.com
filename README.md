Welcome to the repository for Canonical's new **canonical.com** website‚Äîbuilt with a focus on performance, scalability, and ease of development.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This site is powered by the lightweight, yet robust [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. To leverage features shared across Canonical sites, we integrate the [base-flask-extension](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/canonicalwebteam.flask-base) module, making the codebase modular and maintainable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Quick Start with `dotrun`

For an easy setup, run the website locally with [`dotrun`](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/dotrun/):

```bash
dotrun
```

After running the server, the website will be accessible at <http://localhost:8002>. 

Once you start modifying files, the server will automatically reload, making the changes available for immediate preview.

## üå± Greenhouse API Integration

To work locally on the **/careers** section, you‚Äôll need to set up an environment variable for the Greenhouse API:

1. Add `HARVEST_API_KEY` to your `.env` file.
2. Retrieve your API key from the [Greenhouse admin panel](https://canonical.greenhouse.io/configure/dev_center/credentials).

With this setup, you‚Äôll have full access to the careers data when developing locally.

## üöÄ Deployment
