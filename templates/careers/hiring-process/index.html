              When assessing talent from across the globe it takes careful planning to build a hiring model that is fair for everyone. We have crafted a recruitment process that allows us to compare applications in a fair and consistent manner ensuring that no single person has an unfair advantage or better chance of success over another.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want everyone to have a chance to present their most relevant skills.  We train our hiring teams to be experts in selecting talent across multiple geographies and cultures and to keep  fairness and equity at the forefront of all decision making.

            <p>
              We have been deliberate in designing an effective hiring process that helps us select those who are most likely to thrive in our environment. We have identified a set of traits and behaviors that we have found to be present in our most exceptional talent at all levels; high academic performance with evidence of initiative, leadership and drive during this period of personal growth, and those with good cognitive ability. So regardless of your level or the longevity of your career, you can expect to be assessed on these two areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, we value people with elevated drive, relentless curiosity and those with true resilience and stamina to solve new problems and do ground-breaking work. We seek people who are motivated by working in an environment that feeds continuous learning and development.

              We believe our business leaders are best placed to select their own talent. Unlike most organizations we do not have a team of HR recruiters making early decisions. Instead we prioritize getting you in front of technical experts in our business. These individuals know our business well and have the knowledge to ensure you are considered for the most suitable team and role.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the start of the process you will be introduced to a Hiring Lead who will handle your application from start to finish. A leader from a business function, your Hiring Lead, will be deeply passionate about attracting exceptional talent and highly skilled in selection processes with the ability to match people to right roles across our business.
