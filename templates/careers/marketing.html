      <p>In marketing you are a representative of Canonical and you are an advocate of our brands and products. We all work together across the full portfolio &ndash; you are expected to understand the big picture of how Canonical's products fit together, there are no siloes. These are not behind-the-scenes roles, they are public leadership roles. We expect our team to be just as comfortable delivering our message online as they are face to face at meetups, meetings, conferences, partner workshops, or press events. From the analyst community to the tech press, from the CIO to the graduate engineer, from prospects to existing customers, we think Ubuntu should be the starting point for technology transformation around open source, and our marketing team are the amplifier for our message.</p>
      <p>This team is all about having the confidence in our ideas and our quality to put us squarely into the frame for companies thinking afresh about their biggest technology questions. Join us if you are passionate about digital marketing and technology products.</p>

      <p>Our team also understands that it's not just about broadcast, it's about feedback, measurement, iteration and improvement. We use analytics to understand how the world is consuming our narrative, and technology to sift through mountains of engagement data to spot the opportunities that are ready to explore further. We delight in showing that we can engineer growth in engagement, awareness, consumption and commerce just as effectively as our colleagues in software development engineer reliability and performance in their products. We are growth hackers at heart. As the tools evolve, so do we, which creates a learning environment that celebrates new ideas which can prove their effectiveness. We're a tiny company in an industry of giants, so we have always punched way above our weight and that’s exactly what we expect from new members of the team too.</p>
