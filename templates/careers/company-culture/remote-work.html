      <p>Canonical has been a fully distributed organisation since its origin in 2004. Most of us work from home, using the latest communications technology to be productive and maintain a high level of coordination with colleagues.</p>
      <p>Digital collaboration allows us to enjoy our home environment and work with the best in the world in our domain. We might be fully remote, but we are closely connected. The walls that exist in a co-located office environment do not exist here.</p>

      <p>At Canonical, you get unprecedented flexibility in how you organise your day. Zero commute means more time for the things you enjoy. At the same time, we have very high expectations of commitment and independent execution.</p>
      <p>We trust each other to be organised and effective in a distributed workplace. Our teams depend on each other and don’t have daily eyes on one another.</p>
      <p>We take our responsibility for the most critical elements of open infrastructure very seriously, and we are committed to quality in every aspect of our product and services.</p>

      <p>We aspire to lead on the global stage. There’s no other way to describe it than hard work, hard challenges and hard competition.</p>
      <p>You will need to show that you can compete in deeply challenging intellectual fields. Your colleagues are aiming for the top, and they depend on you to set the same standard in your area of responsibility. That’s tough but incredibly satisfying. We value those who take ownership of their area and take opportunities to be exceptional.</p>

      <p>Canonical is uniquely global &mdash; we hire the best, <a href="/careers/company-culture/diversity/">regardless of nationality or language, creed or colour</a>, and we serve the global market for technology in open infrastructure and open applications.</p>
      <p>We optimise our team structure for time zone overlap. Collaboration and inspiration takes time to fully develop but leadership at Canonical means building cross-team relationships. We nurture those relationships through regular global summits which bring diverse teams or their leaders together.</p>
      <p>We host these events around the world to discover great places to explore and appreciate in the process. Team events have taken place in Vancouver, Brugge, New York, Budapest, Orlando, Cape Town, Warsaw, Seoul, Paris, Portland, Lyon, London, Toronto and many more.</p>

      <p>As our customers transform their deepest and most important infrastructure to benefit from open source, they trust us to advise them and lead them to best practice. That also takes time on site, to whiteboard and to work shoulder to shoulder in their development halls and data centres. Many teams at Canonical travel for that deep customer presence.</p>
      <p>If you are excited to see the world, Canonical is a great place to be. We expect everybody at Canonical to be willing and able to travel for up to two weeks at a time, four times a year.</p>
