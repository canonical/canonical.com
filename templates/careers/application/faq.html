                <p>In general we expect our people to be able to travel 2-4 times a year to attend our Sprints. Our Sprints are in-person events where our functions come together to plan roadmaps, share learnings, collaborate and work on initiatives&hellip; and simply have great fun!  The locations for these sprints vary but are usually between EMEA and AMER and they usually last 1 week, occasionally 2 depending on your involvement. For  example, In 2022, we travelled to Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Montreal and Prague. For some roles i.e. Sales, Field, Alliances etc there will be a more regular requirement to travel. Please make sure that you ask about the specific requirements during your interview with the team.</p>

                <p>The GIA assessment rates a candidate's overall train-ability and speed of adaptation in dynamic environments. It is an 'Aptitude' assessment that assesses speed of trainability, mental processing speed, concentration, response to training and a prediction of potential to grasp a new role. The overall percentile is a weighted combination of Perceptual Speed, Number Speed & Accuracy, Reasoning, Word Meaning and Spatial Visualisation. The overall percentile is an estimate of the candidate's general intelligence, reflecting both fluid and crystallised intelligence, against a norm group. The norm group is refreshed every 5 years and is made up of circa 16,000 people in the age group 18-73. Its accent is on response to training, mental processing speed, concentration and potential.</p>

                <p>We try to hire with potential in mind and divert you to other roles that we feel might be a better fit for you. If you have been rejected for a role you may not quite have the right skills required at that point in time. There is no limit on when you can apply again, but it probably means that you may need to gain some more experience before applying to the same role again.</p>
