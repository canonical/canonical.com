We therefore ask for you to omit any information or links that make you personally identifiable i.e. GitHub, LinkedIn links, etc. We assume you have included this information in your application set questions or on your resume, so we will already hold this separately. Our Written Interview assessment will be based purely on the skills you possess and display in this document.</p>

It is an 'Aptitude' assessment that assesses speed of trainability, mental processing speed, concentration, response to training and a prediction of potential to grasp a new role. The overall percentile is a weighted combination of Perceptual Speed, Number Speed & Accuracy, Reasoning, Word Meaning and Spatial Visualisation. The overall percentile is an estimate of the candidate's general intelligence, reflecting both fluid and crystallised intelligence, against a norm group. The norm group is refreshed every 5 years and is made up of circa 16,000 people in the age group 18-73. Its accent is on response to training, mental processing speed, concentration and potential.</p>

If you have been rejected for a role you may not quite have the right skills required at that point in time. There is no limit on when you can apply again, but it probably means that you may need to gain some more experience before applying to the same role again.</p>
