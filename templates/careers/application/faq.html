                <p>No. The GIA assessment rates a candidate's overall trainability and speed of adaptation in dynamic environments. It is an ‘Aptitude’ assessment that assesses speed of trainability, mental processing speed, concentration, response to training and a prediction of potential to grasp a new role. The overall percentile is a weighted combination of Perceptual Speed, Number Speed & Accuracy, Reasoning, Word Meaning and Spatial Visualisation. The overall percentile is an estimate of the candidate's general intelligence, reflecting both fluid and crystallised intelligence, against a norm group. The norm group is refreshed every 5 years and is made up of circa 16,000 people in the age group 18-73. Its accent is on response to training, mental processing speed, concentration and potential. </p>
