We love the question “Why?” and are relentless in finding answers through user interviews, data, and experimentation.", "In this team, it's important to have a sense of ownership. Every part of the product's success is your responsibility. You will work closely with the CEO and collaborate with every part of the organisation to realise that success &mdash; whether it's marketing, sales, engineering, or any other key stakeholder.", "We look for people who are excellent communicators and can speak to and write effectively for everyone &mdash; from marketers to engineers to c-suite executives. You communicate in the format the audience best receives information, whether that's written, visually, or with data. Through it all, you communicate with confidence and empathy.", "You take a strategic approach and use the available resources to deliver as much value to the business and customers as possible. You understand the long game and spend a lot of time looking around corners, envisioning what might go right and what might go wrong.", "Through it all, you are process-driven and focused. You'll keep our product teams on track by documenting dependencies, planning sprints, and staying ahead of issues that might block our progress."],
