        Career-focused Qualifications Model
      </h3>
      <p>
        Our program combines the rigor of professional certification with the
        skills validation of a qualification program. Each professional track
        denotes that the successful candidate is qualified to perform the
        occupation to Canonical standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, some organizations may offer a “certificate”, which does
        not validate professional competency, but indicates the completion of
        something, such as a training exercise, an online course, or a workshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our exams assess and verify professional competence by isolating tasks
        commonly associated with an occupational role, identifying the priority
        and criticality of each task to the role, and creating assessment
        exercises and items in proportion to these priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process is governed by stringent methodologies agreed upon by
        multiple training, talent development, customer education, and formal
        academic bodies. Successful performance on an exam verifies occupational
        competence, and as such, the creation and implementation of skills
        assessments are held to the highest standards of instructional design.
      </p>
      <h3 id="about-the-academy-preparing-for-a-complete-qualification">
        Preparing for a Complete Qualification
      </h3>
      <p>
        Each occupational track has different requirements, and exams can be
        taken at your own pace. The SysAdmin track requires receiving a passing
        score on all four exams: Using Linux Terminal, Using Ubuntu Desktop,
        Using Ubuntu Server, and a fourth exam on more advanced skills currently
        in development, with each exam lasting between 60-90 minutes depending
        on test taker’s proficiency and speed. (Those requiring additional
        accommodations should email their request to
        <a href="mailto:exams@canonical.com">exams@canonical.com</a> prior to
        the exam date.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Each exam is a hybrid format featuring multiple choice, scenario-based,
        and performance-based questions. Candidates will engage with a virtual
        system and perform various administrative and operational tasks, as well
        as answer questions about specific system configurations or general
        Linux knowledge. Instructions for hands-on activities will be found to
        the right of the exam environment. (see the “In-exam Environment”
        section for more details.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Exams may be taken individually or combined in any order to form the
        overall qualification, according to the needs of the test taker.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the SysAdmin qualification, successful completion of all four exams
        indicates a well-rounded knowledge of Linux Terminal, Ubuntu Desktop,
        and Ubuntu Server. Canonical SysAdmins are able to troubleshoot,
        configure, install, and maintain systems, processes, and general
        activities associated with using Linux, Ubuntu Desktop, and Ubuntu
        Server as a system administrator or IT professional. Subject matter
        depth is validated by several practical hands-on challenges and subject
        matter breadth is evaluated by a number of multiple-choice questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exams are based on the year of the LTS running on test nodes. The 2024
        exams are all based on 24.04 (Noble Numbat), and will not change again
        until the 2026 exams are available for the 26.04 LTS cycle.

        General scoring information
      </h3>
      <p>
        Each item’s score is weighted based on the steps, complexity, and
        importance to the occupational role as determined by a panel of industry
        experts. Items are also reviewed continuously for item quality using
        industry-standard assessment metrics. Each overall exam score is based
        on subject matter experts’ (SMEs’) assessment via a standard “cut score”
        methodology. The 2024 edition of Using Linux Terminal has a passing
        score of 70. These scores may change with exam updates due to the nature
        of this calculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exams that do not receive a passing score are released immediately.
        Exams that receive a passing score are reviewed for abnormalities and
        honor code compliance before badges are issued. If you have not received
        a score in 48 hours, contact the Canonical Exams team at
        <a href="mailto:exams@canonical.com">exams@canonical.com</a>.

      <p>
        All exam content is based on industry standard best practices for
        technical certification. Exam scope is determined by extensive industry
        analysis, including reviews of job listings, college curriculum,
        technical expertise, and screened by a survey of industry professionals
        to determine the occupational relevance of exam domains and exercises.
        Items are written and reviewed with feedback from subject matter experts
        and are continuously monitored for item quality and performance metrics.

        Each exam badge can be combined and applied toward a qualification or

        know exactly how recent your experience is without the implication that
        those skills expire. (2024 candidates should contact us at

      <p>
        Exam proctoring will require the use of your web camera and microphone,
        and will also require you screenshare your entire screen during the
        exam. No more than one display is allowed for the duration of the exam.
        Before entering the exam environment you will receive an email from our
        partner, Proctor 360, in order to complete your systems verification
        check. We STRONGLY advise doing this as soon as possible prior to your
        exam time to prevent delays in entering the exam.

      </p>
      <p>
        Candidates are advised to use a Chromium-based browser. Firefox is NOT
        supported at this time, although we intend to support it at a future
        time. The exam is conducted via web browser, and any operating system
        capable of running a modern browser is acceptable, although we recommend
        a large display size. Please note that due to the nature of a
        browser-based environment, some shortcuts may not be available. Of
        particular note is Ctrl-W, commonly used in the terminal but also used
        to close your tab.

        browser to screen to room environment, is recorded and screened for
        abnormalities. These sessions are reviewed by AI as well as human

        Candidates found to violate any rules listed in the exam code of

        retakes and may be banned from Canonical exams for a short time or
        permanently, at the discretion of Canonical staff. If you believe your

      <p>
        For the duration of your exam, you will need the Proctor 360 browser

      <p>
        The Proctor360 Chrome Extension enables secure remote proctoring by
        providing features that ensure the integrity of online exams. Its
        primary purpose is to facilitate secure password entry and monitor the
        exam environment through browser lockdown and activity tracking,
        ensuring a fair test-taking experience.

      <h3 id="proctoring-permissions">Permissions</h3>
      <p>
        Exam securing or proctoring features may ask for permissions to your web

      <p>
        In order to validate that the person taking the exam is the person
        earning the credit, we must adhere to strict proctoring standards. Exams
        that refuse to allow recording or that do not provide ID verification
        will be subject to one of the following, at the discretion of Canonical
        Academy staff:
      </p>

        <li>Academy access banned</li>

      <p>
        Note that ID validation checks for name, photo ID, and the validity of
        the type of identification used, such as appropriate seals and logos,
        and these elements should not be covered during check-in. Any additional
        information, such as address, is not reviewed, and the covering of this
        type of sensitive information will not be counted against the candidate.

        The exam environment is a browser-based Ubuntu Desktop, and exam
        instructions will load in a browser window upon entry. You can minimize
        and move this window around as needed. Any applications you require are
        loaded onto the node. Select “Continue Assessment” to begin reviewing
        exam items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals are discouraged from using reference materials from outside
        of the exam environment. All exam tasks, including connecting to other
        nodes, will occur within the browser-based exam environment and will not
        require any resources from the user’s host system. In-exam browsers
        allow access to documentation and Ubuntu manpages. Exam environments use
        <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Minimal">Minimal Ubuntu images</a> and
        have man pages pre-loaded on the initial node only.
      </p>
      <p>
        While some events may be nonfatal, please note that the environment is
        as realistic as possible. It is your responsibility to not put the
        system in an unrecoverable state.

        The exam environment allows you to move freely through items, change
        answers, and flag items for later review.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exam environment instructions have three main areas. To the left of
        the screen you’ll notice exam item navigation. This will highlight what
        item you are on, and allow you to move freely through the exam.
        Candidates are encouraged to respond to items in the order they prefer
        and review them as needed.
      </p>

        The central panel includes each exam item with complete directions and
        any node information or command details needed. Next to the content tab
        there is a Notes tab provided for convenience. In addition, candidates
        may choose to use the “Flag for review?” checkbox to screen on the
        assessment completion page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The right panel includes key environment and exam information that will
        be used throughout the exam. The bottom right features a timer.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a final assessment review page allowing candidates to check
        that all items have been viewed, and identify any items left for
        additional review.
      </p>

        After reviewing their assessment, candidates can click on “Complete
        Assessment”. After submitting the assessment for scoring, candidates can
        close their proctoring session and terminate their screen-sharing.

        Should you unintentionally close your environment, please return to
        <a href="https://academy.canonical.com">academy.canonical.com</a> to
        access it again or relaunch from the proctoring email. The exam timer
        will continue to run even if you are disconnected.

      <p>
        Please note that due to the nature of a browser-based environment, some
        shortcuts may not be available. Of particular note is Ctrl-W, commonly
        used in text editors but also used to close your tab.

        Exam environments are provided to the browser via Glyptodon using
        Guacamole. As exams load there will be a moment where the screen is
        black and the clipboard instructions are shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the black screen lasts longer than 20 seconds, please contact us at
