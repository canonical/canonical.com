          Canonical supports several large open source foundations, including the Eclipse Foundation, Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and the Gnome Foundation. We're also supporting Trifecta Tech to build a <a href="https://trifectatech.org/blog/memory-safe-sudo-to-become-the-default-in-ubuntu">memory-safe sudo</a>, and uutils, a <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/adopting-sudo-rs-by-default-in-ubuntu-25-10/60583#p-156027-progress-on-coreutils">memory-safe version of coreutils</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're committed to giving back, and donating to the open source projects that our work depends on. Since April 2025, we've also begun donating to individual maintainers using <a href="https://thanks.dev/home">thanks.dev</a>. Thanks.dev's algorithm distributes the funds based on our projects' dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that these donations will help to demonstrate our appreciation for the hard work of our open source community.

        <p>
          Until Juju, deploying services into cloud and hyperscale environments was complex, error-prone, and time-consuming. Juju is Canonical's open source cloud control plane. It simplifies the deployment and the operation of cloud applications on any infrastructure.

          Cloud computing needed an open source, enterprise-scale infrastructure platform. Thanks to the work of Canonical and many other contributors, we have OpenStack. With the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/openstack-with-sunbeam-for-small-scale-private-cloud-infrastructure">Sunbeam project</a>, users can scale and operate their OpenStack control plane on Kubernetes, while running data plane workloads on bare-metal or virtual machines. With Sunbeam, OpenStack can be adopted by almost anyone &ndash; stress-free.

          A cross-platform client interface needs a cross-platform graphics stack. Mir is a library for building modern display compositors &ndash; software that produces graphical user interfaces. Mir has excellent performance, compatibility, and developer experience.

      {%- if slot == 'list_item_description_7' -%}
        <p>
          In cloud environments, image-sprawl can quickly become unmanageable. Cloud-init is a system initialization program that imports data from the provider (e.g. Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure), which can be used to configure new images with greater control.

      {%- if slot == 'list_item_description_8' -%}
        <p>
          Installing and deploying cloud computing at scale is often complicated and time consuming. Metal as a Service (MAAS) lets you treat physical servers like virtual machines in the cloud, turning your bare metal into an elastic, cloud-like resource.

          Before Netplan, Linux networking could be inconsistent and complex across different distros and environments. Netplan is a unified, modern interface based on YAML files that helps users easily connect to networks.

      {%- if slot == 'list_item_description_11' -%}
        <p>
          SQLite is the world's most widely used database engine for SQLs. It's efficient, self-contained, and lightweight. Dqlite retains the benefits of SQLite, and distributes it across multiple machines in a cluster. This ensures the data will survive node failures, making systems more resilient.

        <p>
          Kubeflow is the most widely used open source MLOps platform. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for the end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) development lifecycle. Kubeflow lets you define and run repeatable ML pipelines, run distributed training jobs, serve models, and operationalize your machine learning infrastructure at scale.

          Generating useful insights from massive data sets can be difficult and slow. OpenSearch is a powerful tool that helps you search, analyze, and visualize huge amounts of data in real time. It is also used for data observability, data ingestion, Security Event and Information Management (SIEM), vector databases and more.

        <p>
          Valkey is a low-latency in-memory store. It is typically used as a cache to improve application response times but can also be used to perform real-time analytics or as a lightweight message queueing system.
