        <p>
          Relational databases are systems to store, retrieve and manage digital information. They are one of many types of databases and, as their name implies, they enable us to express relations between groups of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relational database management systems (RDBMS) organise data into tables. Each table is a set of rows where every cell has a type defined by its column. Each row is uniquely identified among all rows in the same table by
          a set of columns, called the primary key. A table can relate to another table by referencing its primary key.
          This relation is often called a foreign key. Foreign keys are used to express and enforce inclusion type
          relations between different tables at a database level.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you can express that a table is the “child” of another one. The orders table can be considered a
          child of the customers table in the following diagram:

      <div class="col">
        <p>
          Relational databases are named after the relational model formalised by Edgar Frank Codd (also known as Ted
          Codd) in 1969. The diagram below maps the relational model terminology, as presented by Ted Codd, to RDBMS's
          terminology:
        </p>

                    alt="Diagram mapping relational model terminology",
                    width="1200",
                    height="800",

                    loading="lazy") | safe
          }}
        </div>
        <p>
          The success of relational databases is rooted in the solid mathematical foundations of Ted’s model. Most
          relational database management systems use SQL to access the database. The versatility of the SQL language is
          another reason for the success of RDBMS.

        <p>
          SQL is a popular declarative programming language where you specify the tuples to retrieve without specifying
          the algorithmic steps to retrieve those tuples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike imperative languages, such as C, where you specify the exact commands to be executed by a computer, SQL
          lets you focus on the intended result. RDBMS solutions often support the SQL language as a medium to retrieve
          and change the stored data. Therefore, it is common to refer to relational databases as SQL databases.

              Relational databases are a battle-tested technology that's been successfully used in all IT sectors (from
              banking to telecommunications, healthcare and hospitality) for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default and when faced with unexpected software or hardware failures, most relational databases favour
              the consistency and durability of data over the ability to immediately access data. Therefore, if preserving
              your data is among your most important criteria then you definitely should consider relational databases.

            <p>
              The relational model enables you to re-use your existing data without duplicating all or part of it in
              order to accommodate new relations (as it might be the case with simpler key-value or document paradigms).
              Moreover, most RDBMS are optimised for disk access and can scale well to TBs of data per single server while
              providing good performance.

            <p>
              The flexibility of the relational model and the SQL language lets you run custom queries over your data
              while providing decent performance. Most popular RDBMS’ engines are capable of generating an optimised
              access plan even when faced with complex queries. Therefore, you can run new queries on the fly and delay
              their tuning for later (typically by creating indexes).

              There are undeniable benefits to using the best specialised database for every use case you need to
              support. For example, we can make a case for using a graph database to manipulate graph data. Yet,
              multiplying your data stores comes with consistency, cost and operability issues that you need to account
              for before making your decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mature relational databases support a variety of additional paradigms like key-value and document ones.
              They can efficiently manage geographical data, unstructured or semi-structured data. They also often provide
              text search capabilities and are a pertinent choice for analytical use cases. Therefore relational databases
              can allow you to accommodate a variety of new use cases and paradigms and scale them enough before needing a
              more specialised database.

              The relational model is proposed by Ted Codd as a way to overcome the downsides of early record-at-a-time
              databases, such as IDS. The relational model decorrelates the physical layout of the data from its logical
              representation sparking a number of relational model implementations.
