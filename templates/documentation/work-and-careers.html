            <div class="col-6 col-medium-4">
              <p>
                In some software organisations, the work of documentation specialists &ndash; is to produce documentation. They receive explanations and descriptions of software from their engineering colleagues, and turn those into polished output. They are expert technical <em>writers</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our documentation specialists have a different role. They are technical <em>authors</em>, members of our engineering teams. They are called Technical Authors because they have  technical authority: they know their products in depth, and are part of the software development process.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Technical Author's work shapes the way our products are conceived and presented. Amongst other things, it's reflective, critical, active and creative. It's work that feeds back into the product itself, and helps define what it is, and always seeks new and better ways to add to its value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Technical Authors come from many backgrounds, including academic research, software engineering and journalism. What they have in common is that they are expert, effective communicators. They share an intense sense of technical curiosity, and a strong feeling for the perspective of a product's users. Their strength of imagination and qualities of empathy are crucial to their work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Documentation is something that everyone contributes to; Technical Authors encourage and lead documentation work, and help guarantee its quality.

              <p>
                We have a rigorous hiring process for Technical Authors. Once your application is processed, you will be invited to complete a written interview, covering numerous aspects of your career, work in and thoughts on documentation and your education. Stages along the way include:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-9 col-medium-6">
              <hr class="p-rule" />
            </div>
            <h3 class="col-3 col-medium-2 p-heading--5">Written interview</h3>
            <div class="col-6 col-medium-4">
              <p>
                The written interview is an important part of the process. It's reviewed - anonymously, in an effort to remove bias - by multiple members of the team.
              </p>
              <p>
                This has several benefits. One is that in-person interviews are stressful experiences, while a written interview gives you all the time you need to gather your thoughts and put them together in a way that presents you at your best. It's a good opportunity to say things that might not otherwise come up later.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's also excellent preparation for the interviews that will come. We want to see your best, and for you to be prepared for them. And we want them to be a good experience for you too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our written interviews are used by all the future in-person interviewers you'll meet. When you do meet them, they'll already have had a good introduction to you, so that you don't need to repeat the same stories and explanations to multiple people.
              </p>

We want to see how you approach issues such as meeting user needs and documentation structure, and your analytical and critical skills.

        <p>
          Don't forget that you are interviewing us as much as we are interviewing you. We want you to be an active participant in the process, not just someone who answers our questions.

        <p>
          You will spend a large proportion of your life each day at work. We, as much as you, want to be sure that you're in the right place, one where you will be successful, fulfilled and happy.
