          <div id="introduction">
            <p>For too long in our industry, documentation has been allowed to be a secondary aspect of software development. Our approach will make documentation a core engineering concern, governed by systematic principles and requiring conscious practice, whose values inform the work not just of technical authors, but of all our engineering and product teams.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question-heading" id="documentation-as-practice" style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5rem;">
            <h2>Documentation as practice</h2>
            <p>A central principle we hold is that <strong>documentation is an engineering practice, rather than an engineering task.</strong></p>
            <p>At Canonical, engineers and product managers make real and substantial contributions to documentation, as part of their everyday work. Documentation is not a siloed activity, it's a responsibility shared by everyone who works in engineering, product or support.</p>
            <p>Everyone is expected to think and care about documentation, specialists and non-specialists alike, in just the same way that quality and security are shared concerns. If you're applying to Canonical for an engineering role, don't be surprised to be asked about your work in &mdash; or your thoughts on &mdash; documentation at a job interview.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question-heading" id="documentation-with-rigour" style="scroll-margin-top: 4.5rem;">
            <h2 >Documentation with rigour</h2>
            <p>It's a key part of our project in documentation to understand and define documentation as a rigorous discipline in software engineering, one with rules that apply generally, are derived from sound principles, and are tested in action.</p>
            <p>Documentation in software deserves &mdash; but has never enjoyed &mdash; <strong>a scientific approach</strong>. We need our ideas and models to be examined and challenged, not just by us and our colleagues, but beyond Canonical too. Our models are <em>working models</em>, not the last word on the subject.</p>
            <p>Documentation practitioners at Canonical are not just in the business of producing documentation &mdash; not even just the business of producing excellent documentation. They have a responsibility to advance the state of the art of documentation, and to advance documentation practice itself.</p>
            <p>We work together towards this end, to define the practice of documentation. Our approach is critical, exploratory, collaborative and iterative.</p>
