            Everyone who has any experience with OpenStack knows this feeling very well. You want to try it. You're committed to learning it. You even start exploring its documentation. But then, almost immediately, <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/_images/openstack-arch-kilo-logical-v1.png">you are exposed to its complex architecture</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tens of services, hundreds of processes, thousands of different configuration options: all of that to meet the needs of the most demanding industries, end users and their use cases. But do you really need all this overhead? What if all you need is your own general-purpose cloud?
          </p>
          <p>Keep reading to learn how Canonical OpenStack helps you bypass all this complexity.</p>

        <p>
          If you want to use OpenStack, but don't necessarily want to deal with its internals, you're in the right place. Canonical effectively tames the complexity of the upstream OpenStack project and delivers its distilled excellence in the form of a human-friendly product &mdash; Canonical OpenStack.

            Canonical OpenStack comes with a fully cloud-native architecture based on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/security/docker-images">OCI images</a> and <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snaps</a>. This decouples OpenStack from the underlying Ubuntu OS and makes its updates and upgrades simple, straightforward and user-friendly.

            OpenStack uses a modular architecture with every service responsible for an individual cloud feature. This includes identity management, an image catalogue as well as all the compute, network and storage functions that are typically required to provision and decommission virtual machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The services are further broken down into processes based on a microservices architecture. Each process implements an atomic cloud function, such as handling user requests, proxying database queries or invoking various types of backend technologies used by OpenStack underneath.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to minimise its footprint, Canonical OpenStack ships with only the key features enabled by default. Additional features, such as CaaS or a Load Balancer can be enabled post-deployment with a single terminal command.

          In principle, OpenStack resembles the behaviour of leading public clouds. Users can provision resources from their own pool through a self-service portal. All requests are handled by OpenStack itself in a fully automated way. Don't believe it?

                OpenStack enables on-demand resource provisioning. This means that users can request them at any time through the client, dashboard or APIs. No admin intervention is required. No ticket is needed to process users' requests. Provisioning happens behind the scenes. OpenStack takes care of everything.
