# Canonical General Conditions of Purchase

These Canonical General Conditions of Purchase ("**GCP**") shall apply
to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Purchase Orders issued by Canonical (&quot;**PO**&quot;) and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any other agreement signed by the Parties (&quot;**Other Terms**&quot;),
except as otherwise stated therein.

In the event of inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of the
documents comprising this Agreement, the order of precedence shall
be as follows:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The PO, including any special terms and conditions stated therein;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Other Terms (as applicable), including schedules, attachments, or exhibits;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) These GCP.<br />
(Collectively the "**Agreement**")

To the extent possible, all documents shall be interpreted so as to be
consistent with one another. However, in the event of conflict, the
document higher in the order of precedence shall prevail.<br />
Any terms and conditions proposed by the Supplier that are not
expressly accepted in writing by Canonical shall be deemed null and
void and shall not form part of the Agreement.<br />
This Agreement shall come into effect upon the earlier of:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Supplier's signature, or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Supplier's commencement of performance.

The Agreement is entered into between the Canonical entity set out
in the PO or Other Terms for the benefit of itself and its affiliates
("**Canonical**") and the supplier identified in the Agreement
("**Supplier**") and shall take effect on the earliest of: the Supplier's
signature or upon the Supplier's commencement of performance.

## Scope of the Agreement

The Agreement covers the following scope: (i) Goods - where a
purchase or rental of tangible goods and/or software (including
software licenses) is taking place; (ii) Services - where services are
performed by the Supplier; and (iii) Deliverables - any output from the
provision of goods or services by the Supplier including any
intellectual property ("IP") which constitute "work made for hire".

## Operative Provisions

<h3 id="1-fees-and-payment" style="scroll-margin-top:3.5rem;">1. Fees and payment.</h3>

1.1. <u>Invoice timing.</u> The Supplier shall invoice the fees
monthly in arrears (for provision of Services) or upon Canonical's
final acceptance of the Goods (for purchase of Goods). Canonical
will pay within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of a valid and
undisputed invoice to accountspayable@canonical.com.

1.2. <u>Payment information.</u> Supplier shall ensure that each
of its invoices sets out a comprehensive description and a valid
Canonical purchase order number for the amount of such invoice.
Supplier shall further ensure correctness of its bank account
details, including but not limited to confirming that the bank
account that Canonical will use for payment is set out in the
vendor form provided by Canonical during the onboarding
process. Any changes to bank account details are communicated to
Canonical through an updated vendor form available at
https://apps.docusign.com/webforms/us/8b32fb9f2753352b6e7177c7e29173f4 and sent to accountspayable@canonical.com. The
parties acknowledge that any other bank account details, including
any bank details set out in Supplier invoices, will not be considered.

1.3. <u>Specification of fees.</u> The fees under the PO are the
only amounts payable by Canonical.

<h3 id="2-taxes" style="scroll-margin-top:3.5rem;">2. Taxes.</h3>

The fees are exclusive of VAT and any other applicable
sales tax required by law. Canonical may withhold or deduct any
amounts from the fees to pay any tax required by applicable law.
Supplier will indemnify and hold Canonical harmless from any claims,
costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and liabilities related to
Supplier's taxes.

<h3 id="3-acceptance" style="scroll-margin-top:3.5rem;">3. Acceptance.</h3>

The Goods and Services shall comply with all
specifications set out by Canonical. Canonical may terminate the
Agreement or an applicable PO tried to if the Supplier does not meet
the applicable specifications. All Goods and Services will be subject to
Canonical's inspection and testing both during the period of
manufacture and prior to final acceptance. Notwithstanding the
above, no Canonical inspection or testing will relieve the Supplier of
any liability arising out of (i) defects to the Goods or Services or (ii) any
other failure to meet the requirements of the Agreement. If it
becomes apparent that any Goods or Services are defective (including
but not limited to defects in materials or workmanship) or do not
conform with the requirements under the Agreement, Canonical may
in its sole discretion: (i) reject the affected Goods or Services, in which
case no further fees will be due by Canonical to Supplier and Supplier
shall promptly refund any fees already paid by Canonical for the
rejected Goods or Services, (ii) request prompt correction or
replacement at Supplier's expense, or (iii) accept the defective Goods
or Services subject to a fee adjustment. All Goods and Services will be
subject to final inspection and acceptance by Canonical at a location
designated by Canonical within a reasonable time after delivery or
performance.

<h3 id="4-delivery-delays" style="scroll-margin-top:3.5rem;">4. Delivery delays.</h3>

Except in case of force majeure and without
prejudice to its other rights and remedies, in the event that Supplier
does not deliver the applicable Goods, Services and/or Deliverables by
the agreed delivery date, Canonical reserves the right to apply a
penalty of 2% of the amount of the purchase order for each complete
week of delay of the agreed delivery date, up to a maximum of 10%.

<h3 id="5-ownership-and-intellectual-property-rights" style="scroll-margin-top:3.5rem;">5. Ownership and Intellectual Property rights.</h3>

5.1. <u>Ownership of pre-existing IP.</u> Each party will retain
ownership of its pre-existing IP and any IP developed outside of
the scope of the Goods and Services covered by the Agreement.

5.2. <u>Licensing of pre-existing IP.</u> The Goods and Services
provided by Supplier shall be deemed to include a licence for any
pre-existing IP necessary for the free and unlimited use of the
Goods and Services by Canonical, including for their repair,
modification and replacement by Canonical or by any third party
designated by Canonical, within the scope of Canonical's activities.

5.3. <u>Deliverables.</u> Supplier hereby assigns all rights
(including Intellectual Property rights) now or in the future arising
in relation to the Deliverables to Canonical with full title
guarantee. The Supplier shall provide such assistance as is
reasonably necessary to Canonical and shall sign or arrange the
signature of any associated documentation which is in the view of
Canonical reasonably necessary to perfect this assignment. To the
extent any of the rights, title and interest in the Deliverables
cannot be assigned by Supplier to Canonical, Supplier hereby
grants to Canonical and its affiliates a perpetual, worldwide,
exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable licence under such
rights, title and interest, with rights to sublicense through multiple
tiers of sublicensees, to practice such non-assignable rights,
including, but not limited to, the right to reproduce, modify,
display, perform and distribute the Deliverables. To the extent any
of the rights in the Deliverables can neither be assigned to
Canonical nor licensed by Supplier to Canonical and its affiliates,
Supplier irrevocably waives and agrees never to assert such non-assignable and non-licensable rights against Canonical or its
affiliates, any of their successors in interest, or any of their
licensees, either direct or indirect. If the Parties agree that Supplier
may include materials in the Deliverables which are subject to third
party IP ("**Third Party Components**"), such Third Party
Components will be listed in a separate document. Third Party
Components are licensed to Canonical under the licence specified
in the applicable order. If no licence is specified, the Third Party
Component is licensed under this clause 5.3.

5.4. <u>Goods.</u> Ownership and title to Goods (other than
licensed software) will pass from Supplier to Canonical on final
acceptance.

<h3 id="6-representations-and-warranties" style="scroll-margin-top:3.5rem;">6. Representations and warranties.</h3>

<h3 id="8-confidentiality-and-data-protection" style="scroll-margin-top:3.5rem;">8. Confidentiality and data protection.</h3>

8.1. <u>Disclosure and use.</u> During and after the term of the
Agreement or any applicable PO, subject to the exceptions in
Clause 8.1, each party will maintain the confidentiality of the other
party's confidential information, disclosing it only to those of its
affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, professional advisors,
and agents who both (i) need to know it to comply with its
obligations under the Agreement, or to receive the benefit of the
Agreement; and (ii) are under contractual or professional
obligations equivalent to those contained in this Clause 8. The
obligation of confidence will not apply where the confidential

to disclosure by the other party; (ii) is subsequently lawfully
acquired from a third party or independently developed by the
recipient without breach of any known obligation of confidence;
(iii) is or becomes generally available to the public through no act
or default of the recipient; or (iv) is disclosed on a confidential
basis for the purpose of obtaining professional advice. The
receiving party may, without consent, disclose confidential
information if required to do so by law. In such event, the receiving
party will: (i) limit disclosure to the extent and the entities strictly
necessary, and will give the other party as much written notice of
the requirement as legally able; and (ii) assist the other party, at
the other party's cost in seeking a protective order or other
assurance with respect to maintaining the confidentiality of such
confidential information.

8.2. <u>Remedies.</u> Each party agrees that damages would not
be an adequate remedy for any failure to comply with the
confidentiality obligations in the Agreement and that the other
party will be entitled to seek the remedies of injunction, specific
performance and/or other equitable relief for any threatened or
actual failure to comply with those obligations.

8.3. <u>Data Protection Legislation.</u> Each party will comply
with all applicable data protection and privacy legislation, including
but not limited to the Data Protection Act 2018, the General Data
Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) and any national
implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation, as
amended or updated from time to time, and any successor
legislation to the GDPR or the Data Protection Act 2018, as
applicable ("**Data Protection Legislation**"). The provisions of this
clause are in addition to, and do not relieve, remove or replace, a
party's obligations under the Data Protection Legislation.

<u>8.4. Processing data.</u> The parties will, in relation to any
personal data processed in connection with the performance of
the Agreement, only process the personal data: (i) to the extent,
and in such manner, as is necessary in order to comply with
obligations under the Agreement; (ii) in accordance with the Data
Controller's instructions (unless otherwise required in compliance
with applicable laws); and (iii) for the duration of the term of the
Agreement or an applicable PO, unless otherwise instructed by the
Data Controller. The Data Processor will ensure that access to
personal data is limited to those personnel or subcontractors who:
(i) need to access the personal data to meet its obligations under
the Agreement, and (ii) are bound by terms as restrictive as those
set out under the Agreement. The Data Processor will be liable for

and Canonical will enter into a separate data processing
agreement.

written notice of the claim, allowing Supplier sole control of the
defence and settlement of the claim, and cooperating with
Supplier as necessary in the defence and settlement of the claim.

by either party to a meeting between the senior managers of the
parties. Neither party will refer any dispute to the courts unless and
until the dispute resolution procedures of this clause have been
