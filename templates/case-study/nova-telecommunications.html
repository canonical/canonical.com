      <p>
        In the face of rapid technological evolution, one of the constants has been the importance of telecommunications. Telecommunications systems embody technological evolution and bring it within reach of ordinary consumers. The journey from landline telephones to mobile services, 5G and superfast internet has been driven by telco operators who work to commercialize these innovative technologies. In order for telecommunications companies to keep supporting innovation, they need to be innovative with their underlying infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nova is a telecommunications operator that provides mobile, broadband, television and fixed network services to households and businesses in Greece. Recognizing the need for innovation, Nova intends to scale-up and scale-out the services it offers to customers, but wanted to make sure innovation started at home. In order to grow sustainably, improve time to market, and continue delivering high-quality connectivity to their customers, Nova identified Canonical as the partner to help them pivot to a fully open source private cloud infrastructure.

        As one of the leading telco operators in Greece, Nova has a considerable customer base to service. The scale of Nova’s customer base is matched by the breadth of services it offers to customers: high-speed internet, mobile services, television subscriptions and fixed connectivity.

        An additional complication was that Nova’s private cloud infrastructure was split into three separate clouds.

While this was necessary from an operational perspective, the fragmentation of vendors brought additional complexity.

        Canonical OpenStack and Canonical Kubernetes are downstream, Canonical-maintained distributions of the upstream OpenStack and Kubernetes. Like their upstream counterparts, they are fully open source, however as part of the Canonical ecosystem they receive patching and maintenance for up to 12 years. In addition, they are specially built with automation in mind – the “charms” refer to software operators that deliver extensive automation to simplify daily operations and scale out the management and deployment of software. In Nova’s case, this enabled a smooth transition from design to deployment.
