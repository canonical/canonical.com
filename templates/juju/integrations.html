      <p class="p-heading--5">Juju and charms greatly simplify the process of connecting applications and managing the lifecycle of your entire system</p>
      <p>Juju Integrations are virtual connections between applications to allow the exchange of information. The Juju controller acts as a mediator for these virtual connections, letting individual applications directly communicate with each other.</p>
      <p>When an integration is created between two applications or across units of the same application, Integration data is persisted to the controller database.</p>
      <p>Integration data persists across invocations of the charm code and through the various event handlers that may access it.</p>
      <p>Juju is aware of the overall deployment topology, and it uses this information to perform the optimal set of lifecycle management decisions for your entire system, not just individual applications.</p>

        <p>Once the integration is done, Juju will deal with the application configurations and monitoring - you do not need to be an expert on each individual service! You can focus on judging if the resulting deployment is a good representation of your idea or not.</p>
        <p>The optimal configuration is persisted even if one of the applications is scaled, upgraded or the configuration changed. Juju and the charm code take care of it all.</p>
