Each application has a number of deployed "units" and includes information about the services they offer or require.

                An agent is software that works to realise the state declared by an end-user with a client (e.g., the Juju CLI), for an entity (e.g., controller, model, machine, unit) via workers.
              </p>
              <p>
                A worker is a process that an agent runs in the background on a Juju entity (controller, model, machine, unit, etc.) and that performs a single, specific task. A Juju agent runs one or more workers at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>Agents can be of different types:</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/canonical/pebble">Pebble</a> is a lightweight, API-driven process supervisor. In Kubernetes charms it is used to give workload containers something akin to an init system that will allow the charm container to interact with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pebble allows to start, stop, restart and update services while taking into account service dependencies. Pebble implements custom "health checks" that can be configured to restart services when they fail, as well as the ability to forward logs to a remote Loki server.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pebble also includes a subsystem called notices, which allows the user to introspect various events that occur in the Pebble server, as well as record custom client events. The server saves notices to disk, so they persist across restarts, and expire after a notice-defined interval.
